Employee Retention Risk Analysis:

This project focuses on analyzing employee data to identify factors influencing retention and to predict employees at risk of leaving the organization. It combines data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning models to deliver actionable insights for HR departments.

---

Project Objectives:

- Analyze key factors that contribute to employee attrition.
- Predict the likelihood of an employee leaving the company.
- Build and compare different machine learning models.
- Provide visual insights through graphs and charts.

---


Technologies Used:

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

Machine Learning Models:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix used for evaluation.

---

Key Insights:

- Identified top factors affecting retention such as **Job Satisfaction**, **Monthly Income**, and **Years at Company**.
- Developed models capable of predicting employee attrition with reasonable accuracy.
- Visualization helped uncover hidden patterns in data related to age groups, departments, and work environment.
